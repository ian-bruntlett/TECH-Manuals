# Free Software

There are a lot of free software packages out there. The systems I am most
familiar with are Windows and Linux. What I am providing is not an exhaustive
list of packages.

For U.K. government advice on security, see this website - [Cyber
Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberaware/home)

## Windows - Free Software

### Security Software

  * For anti-virus support: Use Windows Defender - it comes free with modern versions of Windows.
  * For anti-malware support. Use <https://www.malwarebytes.com/>. The free version has to be run manually to work. The paid for version is continually running, checking your computer is OK.
  * If your Windows computer is heavily infected with viruses, search on [https://www.microsoft.com/](https://www.microsoft.com) and search for "Windows Defender Offline" where you can download an iso, record it to CD-R using special software, and then use that to boot your computer and remove rootkits and other sneaky nasties. You can possibly use [CAINE](https://www.caine-live.net/) to copy data off the hard drive. 

### Backups

These days the hackers hold your data hostage - they encrypt it and demand a
ransom from you to get your data released - this is commonly known as
"ransomware". There are various service providers for this (Crashplan and
Dropbox) but I don't use them. Best thing to do is to keep all your software
CDs in a safe place (if there are any discs, that is) and keep spare copies of
your data, possibly on recordable CD or DVD or USB thumb drive /flash drive /
memory stick or external USB hard drives.

### Other Utilities

  * [ReactOS](https://reactos.org/) a free, open-source Windows replacement. Tries to run Windows applications and device drivers.
  * [sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/) by [Mark Russinovich](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/markrussinovich/). 
  * [PowerToys from the Microsoft App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD?hl=en-gb&gl=US)
  * [7-Zip to handle additional archive files](https://7-zip.org/)
  * [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
  * [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html)
  * [GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/)
  * [WinDirStat - find out where all your drive space is being used up](https://windirstat.net/)

### DOS and Utilities

  * Guide to [creating a bootable DOS USB stick](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Creating_a_Bootable_DOS_USB_Stick) (Thomas Krenn).
  * [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/) an open source DOS compatible O.S.

The GNU people have created a page about free programs and the commercial
programs they aim to replace right
[here](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:Windows).

## Linux

For information about different Linux or BSD operating systems, see
[DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com).

With Linux (I use mainly [Ubuntu (Debian based)](https://ubuntu.com/) releases
from [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/) \- or [Debian
Linux](https://www.debian.org/) or [lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) on older
computers and someone I know really likes [Peppermint Linux (Debian
based)](https://peppermintos.com/) OR [Antix Linux (Debian
based)](https://antixlinux.com/)), the challenge is knowing which packages
your free software is in.

To install Ubuntu Linux, you'll need an .iso file, downloadable from
[here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/). If you want to download a flavour of
Ubuntu Linux, take a look here [here](https://cdimages.ubuntu.com/). If you
want a different Linux, take a look at [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/)
to find out about other distributions of Linux.

There are other flavours of Ubuntu Linux, for those who aren't keen on Ubuntu.
The Register, in this
[article](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/10/linux_lite_70_arrives/),
discusses [Linux Lite](https://www.linuxliteos.com/) which doesn't require as
much memory as Ubuntu.

With Linux, there are at least two databases about packages. The package
database on your computer tracks what is installed and which version it is.
The databases on the server(s) track information about the packages held on
the server. The use of a Package Manager in Linux is particularly helpful as,
in Ubuntu's case, the software is installed from servers holding repositories
of free software. A package manager can also acts as a kind of safe "Google
for packages to install". If you want some software to accomplish a particular
task, run your Package Manager and take things from there. Also, because of
the databases mentioned previously, a "Software Updater" programme can run
every so often and tell the user about newer releases of currently installed
software.

### If you are thinking of moving from Windows to Linux

  1. Get expert help. If you don't know any local Linux experts, try attending meetings of a local Linux User Group (LUG) and asking questions.
  2. Before you move your system from Windows to Linux, get some real experience of using Linux.
  3. Always back up your data before installing an operating system or re-partitioning your computer's drive.
  4. If you ABSOLUTELY must use Windows specific software and cannot spare time to find a Linux solution, don't bother changing.
  5. At the time of writing, Adobe Software - Photoshop etc does not run on Linux so don't bother changing if you can only use them.
  6. If you can't handle change, don't move from Windows to Linux. Moving takes effort.
  7. Install LibreOffice on Windows. See if you can use it instead of Microsoft Windows. You'll have to use LibreOffice if you move to Linux.

### Moving someone from Windows to Linux (experts only)

  1. Run some tutorial sessions so the new user gets experience of using Linux and can make an informed choice about moving to Linux.
  2. Check for compatibility - on the soon-to-be Linux computer, boot it using a Linux Live USB memory stick to see how well it copes with Linux.
  3. Be prepared to act as their technical support for some time to come. This includes configuring the computer and generally tweaking the operating system and generally helping out.
  4. There are some projects such as [WINE](https://www.winehq.org) which is a compatibility layer for running Windows software on Linux etc systems.

### Frugal Linuxes

  * Alan, another refurbisher of unwanted systems, likes to use [antiX Linux](https://antixlinux.com/) on his old systems, something I haven't experimented with...
  * Useful on slow x86_64 systems is [ArchBang](https://archbang.org/), a live distro.
  * I have experimented with Xubuntu [xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) \- gives Ubuntu with a lighter-weight desktop environment.
  * Something that is intended for really small systems (but quite demanding to install) is [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), with documentation [here](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/) and a [wiki here](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Main_Page).
  * There is also [Tiny Core Linux](http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php) (core is text only, TinyCore has a GUI and CorePlus has extra apps). The book, "Into the core - A look at Tiny Core Linux" is available [online](http://tinycorelinux.net/book.html). 

### Heavy-weight RPM-based Linuxes

  * [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
  * [Red Hat (you need to sign up as a Developer, I believe).](https://www.redhat.com/en)
  * [AlmaLinux - currently 1:1 binary compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://almalinux.org/)

### Linux on Apple hardware

I don't use Apple hardware but if I see any useful things online about running
Linux on Apple hardware, I'll cite them here:

  * [Reviving an old MacBook Pro with Ubuntu Linux (medium.com)](https://medium.com/@rowaido.game/reviving-an-old-macbook-pro-with-ubuntu-linux-689252fa4b9c)
  * [Linux support for Apple devices with the T2 security chip](https://t2linux.org/)

## Creating bootable installation media for downloaded iso files

  * Startup Disc Creator (aka usb-creator-gtk) - for creating install media for different releases of Linux etc. Brasero to record isos onto DVD or CD
  * To create a USB memory stick to boot a single iso, use usb-creator-gtk. If you want multiple isos on a memory stick, see [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html). 
  * Use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) create a bootable USB flash drives (nice GUI etc) in Windows using a single iso file.
  * Use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) create bootable USB flash drives (nice GUI etc) in Windows, Linux, etc to put multiple iso files on the same USB memory stick.

## Linux for phones and other mobile devices (e.g. tablets?)

It's early days yet and I haven't tried this myself. However,
[postmarketos](https://postmarketos.org/) might be of interest.

## Free Software that runs on both Windows and Linux

  * See [here](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:Windows) for a list of popular paid-for Windows programmes and links to their Free Software equivalents that can be used on Windows and Linux..
  * Download LibreOffice from [www.libreoffice.org](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or install the package libreoffice. Many people use it instead of Microsoft Office. LibreOffice provides tools for word-processing (Writer), spreadsheet (Calc), presentation tool (Impress), drawing and flowcharting and simple Desktop Publishing tool (Draw), database (Base) and "Maths" for editing mathematics. See [here](https://documentation.libreoffice.org/en/english-documentation/) for free information.
  * For serious Desktop Publishing use Scribus. Either download it from [here](https://www.scribus.net/) or install the package scribus. Try Googling for a "scribus tutorial" for more information..
  * For photo or image manipulation, download GIMP from here:- <https://www.gimp.org> or install the package gimp. A user guide can be found [here](https://www.gimp.org/docs/). .
  * For diagrams etc, a scalar graphics editor (that treats drawings as a series of individual shapes), see something like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Tutorials can be found [here](https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/). Or you can install the package "dia" to edit diagrams - see [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/) for more details. For mind maps, try the package "freemind" to install it on Linux, you can download it for Windows from [here](https://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/DownloadW).
  * For fun, free fonts see <https://www.google.com/fonts>.
  * To wipe confidential files and free up disk space, see [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/).
  * To create a USB memory stick to boot a variety of ISO files, see [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) listed under Creating bootable installation media.
  * To display technical info about your system see [CPU-Z (for Windows)](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) or CPU-X (for Linux) 

## Linux Live CD/DVDs/ISOs, Repair etc Linux distros (technical stuff)

Some Linuxes come on "live CDs". This means that you can start a computer with
the CD/DVD inside it and have it run Linux without modifying your hard disc. A
live CD/DVD is stored on a server with a filename ending in ".iso". In order
to use it, you or a friend need to download the iso, use special software to
put it onto recordable CD or DVD, and follow the instructions. Use
[Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) create bootable USB flash drives (nice GUI etc)
in Windows. To put multiple isos on the same USB memory stick use
[Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html).

  * [aban](https://aban.derobert.net/) is an open-source alternative to [dban](https://dban.org/). They will both wipe one or more hard discs attached to your computer.
  * [CAINE](https://www.caine-live.net/) is for Linux experts only and is the "Computer Aided INvestigative Environment" and I have used it to rescue data from a poorly Windows system.
  * [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/) is a live CD that is a (hard disc) partitioning and cloning programme. It needs plenty of disc space but is intelligent - it only copies sectors that have information in them.
  * [Finnix](https://www.finnix.org/) \- The original utility live Linux distro. Fits on a CD. Lots of tools but no documentation
  * [GParted](https://gparted.org/) will resize, copy, move and potentially rescue files on a computer's hard disc.
  * [Hiren's Boot CD](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/) is a "first aid kit" for your computer.
  * [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) is used for penetration testing, something I have not tried yet.
  * [memtest86+](https://www.memtest.org/) will help you check your PC's memory, if you suspect that your computer is faulty..
  * [Rescatux & Super Grub 2 Disk](https://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/) will fix filesystems, wipe passwords (Linux/Windows), make a user a sudoer.
  * [Rescuezilla (GitHub)](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/releases) see article on [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/16/rescuezilla_2_5/). Good tool for imaging and restoring drives.
  * [SystemRescue CD](https://www.system-rescue.org/) is a collection of many Linux packages. It is intended for use when you need to fix a problem on your computer.
  * [Ultimate Boot CD - a lot of formerly floppy disk only utilities. There is further info on the website](https://www.ultimatebootcd.com/)

## Linux Software I have used on Linux

This can come in a number of formats. Some as packages (aka .deb files), some
as Snaps. There is a debate over which is the better format. Here is a mixed
collection of software that I like to use on a day to day basis:-

  * LibreOffice - office package already mentioned previously on this page.
  * emacs - a text editor with a LISP programming engine (I am still getting to grips with emacs Lisp)
  * bash - a command line / scripting language that is built into Ubuntu Linux
  * Firefox - web browser
